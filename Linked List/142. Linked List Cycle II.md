F: Number of nodes outside the cycle

C: Number of nodes within the cycle

### Phase1

`fast` `slow`: move pointers, start form the head

#### 1. `slow` Move F nodes

`slow` @ 0

`fast` @ h:   F or (F mod C)

#### 2.  `slow` Move (C-h) nodes

`slow` @ C-h

`fast` @ C-h

So, they should meet

If they fail to meet, It means there is no cycle

### Phase2

$2* Distance(slow) = Distance(fast)$

$ 2 * (F + a) =  F + a + b + a$

$F = b$

SO:

`ptr1`—> head

`ptr2` —> Meat Point

They both walk 1 step a time, and meet at the entrance

### Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution2

1. Establish `visited = set()`
2. Record all the visited nodes
3. If find the next node appeared in `visited` set, return this Node, it's the entrance.

### Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)
